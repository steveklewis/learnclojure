This is my learning Clojure project.

The aim of this repository is to have a place to store any code I write while learning Clojure. Why do I want to learn Clojure? After writing Java for several years, I got tired of the limitations Java has at the language level. In theory, Clojure (or any Lisp) does not have those limitations. Eventually I want to be able to define my own macros and more directly be able to put my thoughts into code.

Even if I never write Clojure for work, I think it will greatly expand my abilities as a developer. I expect this Lisp/functional journey to take about a year and a half, to truly be able to think functionally and work in Clojure fluently. It took me about a year to really be able to crank in Python. So we'll see.

Perseverance will be an important driving force in this journey, as I will need to do some work every day whether I like it or not. But the promise is simpler code, and the possibility of doing something great.
